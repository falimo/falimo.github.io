			<h3 class="section_title">The Inspiration</h3>

			<p>After repeated disappointment with professional portfolio managers Dad chose to manage his nest egg himself.  Without a clear framework or method, he struggled to stay disciplined, and was easily distracted by the latest fads and investment babble.</p>

			<p>To help him (and others like him) we have distilled portfolio management down to its basic essentials, and packed it into a game to test drive.</p>

			<p>As with Dad, we think you will find it useful and fun, and if you choose to implement this approach in the real world, it might help you do a better job than most professional managers, and at a fraction of the cost.</p>

			<h3 class="section_title">The Essentials</h3>

			<p>Stripped down to its’ essentials, portfolio management involves:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>diversification across a range of different asset classes to benefit from non-correlation and reduce overall volatility;</li>
				<li>- allocating to these asset classes to match one’s tolerance for losses over a specified time horizon;</li>
				<li>- holdings that give you exposure to the asset classes.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Leading studiens have shown (1) that these three elements deliver 90% of the returns in a portfolio.  Security selection and market timing rarely improve performance; allthough your investment manager may argue they are the exception.</p>

			<p>We  have focussed on these essentials, and through this game, we hope everyone can do the same.  Don’t just trust us.  Try it and decide for yourself.  It takes a moment to set-up, and little more to manage.</p>

			<h4>Rebalance simply</h4>

			<p>Know at all times how your portfolio is performing against thos with similar objectives, and if you were not trying to time the market.  If you still want to do a bit of market timing, go ahead and rebalance.  It’s easy.  Looking back you can always see if your market timing is working and by how much, and decide if it worth the effort.  We will help you place limits on yourself, so one’s market timing urges are kept in check.</p>

			<h4>Compare and learn</h4>

			<p>A bit of healthy competition doesn’t hur - see how other players with similar objectives are doing.  Check out the leaders - keep tabs on them, and see when, how, and why they rebalance.  Improve your performance with little effort, by learning from the best.  Similarly, share your decisions and performance with others, so they might benefit and learn from you, and maybe even help you along</p>

			<h3 class="section_title">About</h3>

			<p>We are a team of former portfolio managers, who have managed money for wealthy individuals and families.  We have also been responsible for evaluating portfolio managers.</p>

			<p>Based on both inside experience and the quantative research we fundamentally believe people can manage their money better than, and for far less than, the vast majority of professional managers.  So why help them on their way?</p>

			<p>In today’s low return environment, where increasingly people are having to manage their savings and pensions for their own retirements, there has never been a more compelling time.  We did it for Dad, and now we want to do it for others.  With this experience in hand, people will have more control and say in their investment decisions and the world will be a better place.  For us, that would have made it all worthwhile.</p>
